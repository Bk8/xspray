To build Xspray on OSX you need llvm, clang and lldb.

Setting up the folders for correct dependencies:

  WORK  
    `-- lldb
    |
    `-- nui3
    |
    `-- Xspray

Change to the directory where you want to do development work and checkout LLDB:

> svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk lldb
In general, building the LLDB trunk revision requires trunk revisions of both LLVM and Clang but the Xcode project takes care of this directly.

Note1: Beware! If you have installed Xcode 5 and you are trying to build with Xcode 4, chances are the system svn will be v1.7 while Xcode 4 is still 1.6 and it will prevent the build script from fetching llvm and clang sources. If thats the case, use the svn binary that is inside the Xcode bundle like that:
> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk lldb

Note2: I have found that we don't need to use a special cryptographic certificate as the lldb mentions, using the default Mac Developper cert will work fine on any machine. YAY!

------
Xspray:

You can now launch the Xspray workspace in Xcode:
WORK/Xspray/Xspray.xcworkspace

Select the LLDB scheme and edit it to change the default configuration to release. Build LLDB (go have a cup of coffe, it will svn checkout llvm + clang and build them, then build itself, it takes a while). Or watch the all the Lord of the rings movies a couple of times.
Once it is built without error (hopefully) you can select the Xspray project and build it. It should produce a valid Mac application bundle that contains a valid lldb framework (and libclang.dylib).

Warning: for now, the executable I do my tests on is hardcoded in the MainWindow.cpp. Edit it out to point to an existing debugable executable on your machine.

For any question, ask :D
